# KMM-Gen0
KMM Gen.: 0 also know as "Skyrim Settings Manager", version 5.0,

# Description
My first mod manager. Started as just a configurator for the Skyrim original relsease (2011) but then turned into a mod manager. By today standards it's worse than Nexus Mod Manager.

# Package
- Written in Lua using [AutoPlay Media Studio](https://www.indigorose.com/autoplay-media-studio/) v8.x.
- Uses a lot of their party native plugins (binaries not included).
- All the Lua code is inside `Skyrim Settings Manager.autoplay` (which is XML file, about 10-20% here) and the rest scattered inside many `*.api` files (ZIP archives with Lua files inside).
